# Dota Game Screen
A Companion Application for Dota 2 players.

This script, intended for use on a Raspberry Pi, will "listen" to Valve's Dota 2 API, and play a victory video if the player won the game. The victory video is a video which shows the enemy team's ancient exploding, and will display the appropriate team's ancient exploding depending on which team the player was on.

The score screen is shown after the victory video or, if the player did not win, will display immediately upon the game's completion.
